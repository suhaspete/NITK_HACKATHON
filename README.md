J.A.R.V.I.S - Voice Assistant with WolframAlpha Integration
J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a voice-activated assistant built using Python. The assistant responds to voice commands, provides answers to queries using WolframAlpha, and can convert text to speech for seamless interaction.

üéØ Features
Voice Input: Captures user input through the microphone.
Speech Recognition: Uses Google's Speech Recognition API to process spoken commands.
Text-to-Speech: Converts responses to audio using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
WolframAlpha Integration: Retrieves detailed answers to user queries from WolframAlpha's knowledge base.
Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Exit Command: Easily terminate the program by saying "exit."

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
gTTS: For generating speech from text.
Playsound: For playing audio responses.
SpeechRecognition: For processing user voice input.
WolframAlpha API: For fetching answers to user queries.
